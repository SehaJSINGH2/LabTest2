<p>Technology is inevitable and even critical to our daily lives today and plays a vital role in our mental and physical existence in the world – it’s no longer “I think,
 therefore I am” but is “I digitize, therefore I am”.  While technology offers a new and unlimited medium for information and knowledge to our children and a border-free
 means of communication, the negative effects of technology cannot be overstated.Technology has its effects on our physical health it has made our life more comfortable 
 which has made us lathargic.It is making our mental health even more worse.<p>
